# Databases Final Project: Library Management System

Information regarding how to run our program

* To run our program, first clone the repository. 
* It could be helpful to create a folder and store the cloned files in that folder. 
* Make sure that all the libraries/packages listed in the requirements.txt file have been pip installed. 
* After that, open any command line interface that can be used to compile python and navigate to the folder. 
* Run filter.py first and then insert.py right after. 
* If there are write permission errors to books1.csv while running filter.py (because the program creates the books1.csv file and then writes data to it), then delete the book1.csv file, and then run filter.py again. 
* After running both scripts, navigate to the src folder, and run app.py. 
* Lastly, go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and the app will be running on there (Local IP: 127.0.0.1 and Port: 5000).
